# Cursor Rule Writing Style

## Core Principle

**Keep cursor rules concise and focused. Avoid lengthy explanations or verbose instructions.**

## Style Guidelines

### Length and Structure
- Keep rules brief and to the point
- Use clear headings and bullet points
- Focus on essential information only
- Match the length and style of existing rules in this directory

### Content Organization
- Start with core principle or main rule
- Use sections for different aspects if needed
- Include brief examples (❌ Avoid / ✅ Correct) when helpful
- Avoid redundant explanations or background information

### Writing Standards
- Be direct and actionable
- Use simple, clear language
- Remove unnecessary elaboration
- Each rule should be self-contained and scannable

## Markdown File Usage

### Core Principle
**Prioritize direct responses over creating markdown files. Use markdown files only when necessary or explicitly requested.**

### Guidelines
- **Default**: Provide direct answers and explanations in conversation
- **When content is long**: Summarize core points first, then expand if needed
- **Avoid**: Automatically creating markdown files for discussions, analysis, or explanations
- **When markdown might be appropriate**:
  1. First provide key information and core points in conversation
  2. Then ask user if they want detailed information written to a markdown file
  3. Only create markdown after user confirms
- **Create markdown directly only when**:
  - User explicitly requests documentation
  - Complex configuration files or code structures need to be created
  - User asks to "write to file" or "create documentation"

### Communication Style
- Be direct and concise in responses
- Focus on core points first
- Expand details only when necessary
- Avoid token-heavy verbose explanations
- Let users digest information in conversation, not by reading separate files
- When appropriate, offer to create markdown after summarizing key points

## Examples

**❌ Avoid**: Long paragraphs explaining context, history, or detailed rationale
**❌ Avoid**: Multiple nested sections with extensive explanations
**❌ Avoid**: Repeating the same information in different ways
**❌ Avoid**: Creating markdown files for every discussion or analysis
**❌ Avoid**: Writing markdown without asking user first

**✅ Correct**: Concise rules that get straight to the point
**✅ Correct**: Clear structure with essential information only
**✅ Correct**: Brief examples that illustrate the rule
**✅ Correct**: Direct responses with core points, markdown only when necessary
**✅ Correct**: Summarize key points first, then ask "Would you like me to write detailed documentation to a markdown file?"

When creating new cursor rules, reference existing rules in this directory as style examples.
