# Release Note Generation Rules

## Release Note Format and Structure

When generating release notes, follow this exact format and structure:

### Title Format
```
v{VERSION} - {EMOJI} {Main Feature or Improvement Title}
```

Example:
- `v0.0.3 - 🚀 Enhanced RAG System with Collection Upload and Improved Chunking Strategy`
- `v0.0.4-preview.1 - 🔧 Enhanced Configuration Flexibility and Improved Model Serving Capabilities to Support Reasoning Models (e.g., GPT-OSS-20B)`

### Release Notes Section Structure

1. **Feature Highlights** (in order of importance):
   - Use bullet points with bold feature names
   - Each feature should have a clear, concise description
   - Group related features together
   - Use appropriate emojis in section titles (📝 for Release Notes, 📈 for Statistics, 🚀 for Quick Start)

2. **Statistics Section**:
   - Format: `**📈 Statistics**: {X} files changed, {Y} insertions(+), {Z} deletions(-)`
   - Get statistics using: `git diff {previous_tag}..{current_tag} --shortstat`

3. **Quick Start Section**:
   - Always include the Quick Start section with the same structure
   - Include configuration setup instructions
   - Include backend and frontend installation/execution steps
   - Include monitoring commands for Windows and Linux/macOS

### Content Guidelines

1. **Feature Descriptions**:
   - Start with action verbs (Implemented, Enhanced, Refactored, Added, Fixed, etc.)
   - Be specific about what was changed
   - Mention user-facing benefits when applicable
   - Group fixes and improvements logically

2. **Categorization**:
   - **Major Features**: New functionality, significant enhancements
   - **Improvements**: Enhancements to existing features
   - **Bug Fixes**: Fixes for reported issues
   - **Configuration**: Changes to configuration or settings
   - **Performance**: Performance optimizations
   - **Documentation**: Documentation updates

3. **Language Style**:
   - Use present tense for descriptions
   - Be concise but informative
   - Use professional but friendly tone
   - Avoid jargon unless necessary

### Generating Release Notes Process

1. **Get Commit History**:
   ```bash
   git log {previous_tag}..{current_tag} --pretty=format:"%h - %s (%an, %ar)" --reverse
   ```

2. **Get Statistics**:
   ```bash
   git diff {previous_tag}..{current_tag} --shortstat
   git diff {previous_tag}..{current_tag} --stat
   ```

3. **Analyze Commits**:
   - Group commits by type (FEAT, FIX, REFACTOR, CHORE, etc.)
   - Identify major features and improvements
   - Note breaking changes if any
   - Identify bug fixes

4. **Write Release Notes**:
   - Start with the most important features
   - Group related changes together
   - Use consistent formatting
   - Include all relevant improvements and fixes

### File Naming Convention

Release notes should be saved as:
- `RELEASE_NOTES_{VERSION}.md`
- Example: `RELEASE_NOTES_v0.0.3.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES_v0.0.4-preview.1.md`

### When User Requests Release Note Generation

1. Ask for or identify the version tags (previous and current)
2. Run git commands to get commit history and statistics
3. Analyze commits and categorize them
4. Generate release note following the format above
5. Save to appropriate file name
6. Review for grammar and consistency
