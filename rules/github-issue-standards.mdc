# GitHub Issue Creation Standards

When creating GitHub issues, follow these formatting rules for titles and descriptions.

## Issue Title Format

### Core Principle
**All issue titles must start with an emoji that represents the issue type.**

### Emoji Guidelines

#### **Bug Issues** 🐛
- **Always use**: 🐛 for bug reports
- **Format**: `🐛 {Brief description of the bug}`
- **Example**: `🐛 BadRequestError: litellm.BadRequestError: OpenAIException - An assistant message with 'tool_calls' must be followed...`
- **Example**: `🐛 Add error handling for litellm.completion() to ensure checkpoint saves error responses`

#### **Feature Issues**
- **Use context-appropriate emoji** that best represents the feature
- **Common feature emojis**:
  - ⚡️ Performance improvements
  - 🎨 UI/UX enhancements
  - 🔧 Configuration or tooling
  - 📚 Documentation
  - 🔒 Security features
  - 🚀 New capabilities
  - 🎯 Improvements or optimizations
- **Format**: `{Emoji} {Brief description of the feature}`
- **Example**: `⚡️ Enable Streaming Output in CLI`
- **Example**: `📚 Enable Verbose Thinking Content in CLI`

#### **Other Issue Types**
- Choose the most appropriate emoji for the issue type
- Examples: 🔄 (refactor), ♻️ (maintenance), 📝 (documentation), ⚠️ (warning/improvement)

## Issue Description Format

### Brief Description Requirements

1. **Concise and Clear**: One to three sentences describing the issue
2. **Context**: Include relevant code locations or file paths when applicable
3. **Problem Statement**: Clearly state what the problem is or what needs to be implemented
4. **Impact**: Briefly mention why this matters or what happens without the fix
5. **Code Fragments**: When the issue involves specific code, include the relevant code block using code references format

### Code Fragment Format

When including code fragments in the description, use the code reference format:

```
```startLine:endLine:filepath
// code content here
```
```

This format provides direct links to the code in the repository and makes it easy for reviewers to locate the exact code in question.

### Description Examples

**Bug Example (with code fragment)**:
```
In `agent.py` lines 317-329, the `litellm.completion()` call and subsequent response/message processing lack error handling. If an exception occurs, the error response or message cannot be saved to `self.checkpoint`, resulting in loss of debugging information.

```317:329:src/drowcoder/agent.py
        response = litellm.completion(messages=messages, **completion_kwargs)
        message = response.choices[0].message

        if all(getattr(message, attr, None) is None for attr in ['content', 'tool_calls', 'thinking_blocks']):
            finish_reason = response.choices[0].finish_reason or 'unknown'
            message.content = f"Empty response. Finish reason: {finish_reason}"

        self.messages.append(message.__dict__)

        # look out -> message.__dict__ != message.to_dict()
        self.checkpoint.messages.punch(message.to_dict())
        self.checkpoint.raw_messages.punch(response.to_dict())
        self.verbose_latest_message()
```

We should wrap this code in a try-except block to capture and persist error responses to the checkpoint.
```

**Feature Example**:
```
Add support for streaming output in the CLI to provide real-time feedback during agent execution. This will improve user experience by showing progress as it happens rather than waiting for complete responses.
```

## Issue Labels

### Core Principle
**Always suggest appropriate labels based on the issue type and content. Only use labels that exist in the repository.**

### Available Labels

The repository has the following labels available:
- `bug` - Something isn't working
- `documentation` - Improvements or additions to documentation
- `duplicate` - This issue or pull request already exists
- `enhancement` - New feature or request
- `feature` - New feature or request
- `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Extra attention is needed
- `invalid` - This doesn't seem right
- `question` - Further information is requested
- `wontfix` - This will not be worked on

### Label Guidelines

#### **Bug Issues**
- **Primary label**: `bug`
- **Additional labels** (when applicable):
  - `help wanted` - If the bug needs extra attention or community help
  - `good first issue` - If the bug is suitable for newcomers

#### **Feature Issues**
- **Primary label**: `feature` or `enhancement` (both mean "New feature or request")
- **Additional labels** (when applicable):
  - `documentation` - If the feature involves documentation improvements
  - `help wanted` - If the feature needs extra attention
  - `good first issue` - If the feature is suitable for newcomers

#### **Documentation Issues**
- **Primary label**: `documentation`
- **Additional labels** (when applicable):
  - `enhancement` - If it's a new documentation feature
  - `help wanted` - If documentation needs extra attention

#### **Question Issues**
- **Primary label**: `question`

#### **Other Issue Types**
- `duplicate` - For issues that already exist
- `invalid` - For issues that don't seem right
- `wontfix` - For issues that will not be worked on
- `help wanted` - For any issue needing extra attention
- `good first issue` - For issues suitable for newcomers

### Label Selection Process

1. **Identify primary label** based on issue type (bug, feature, documentation, question, etc.)
2. **Add secondary labels** only if they add meaningful categorization
3. **Use `help wanted`** when the issue needs extra attention or community contribution
4. **Use `good first issue`** when the issue is suitable for newcomers
5. **Keep labels relevant** - avoid over-labeling (typically 1-2 labels is sufficient)

## Issue Creation Process

1. **Determine issue type** (bug, feature, etc.)
2. **Select appropriate emoji** based on type
3. **Write concise title** starting with emoji
4. **Provide brief description** with context, problem, and impact
5. **Include code fragments** when the issue involves specific code (use code reference format)
6. **Suggest appropriate labels** based on issue type and content
7. **Include code references** (file paths, line numbers) when relevant

## Complete Issue Examples

### Bug Issue Example

**Title**: `🐛 Handle early exceptions in litellm.completion() to ensure checkpoint saves error responses`

**Brief Description**:
```
In `agent.py` lines 317-329, the `litellm.completion()` call and subsequent response/message processing lack error handling. If an exception occurs, the error response or message cannot be saved to `self.checkpoint`, resulting in loss of debugging information.

```317:329:src/drowcoder/agent.py
        response = litellm.completion(messages=messages, **completion_kwargs)
        message = response.choices[0].message

        if all(getattr(message, attr, None) is None for attr in ['content', 'tool_calls', 'thinking_blocks']):
            finish_reason = response.choices[0].finish_reason or 'unknown'
            message.content = f"Empty response. Finish reason: {finish_reason}"

        self.messages.append(message.__dict__)

        # look out -> message.__dict__ != message.to_dict()
        self.checkpoint.messages.punch(message.to_dict())
        self.checkpoint.raw_messages.punch(response.to_dict())
        self.verbose_latest_message()
```

We should wrap this code in a try-except block to capture and persist error responses to the checkpoint.
```

**Suggested Labels**: `bug`

### Feature Issue Example

**Title**: `⚡️ Enable Streaming Output in CLI`

**Brief Description**:
```
Add support for streaming output in the CLI to provide real-time feedback during agent execution. This will improve user experience by showing progress as it happens rather than waiting for complete responses.
```

**Suggested Labels**: `feature` or `enhancement`

## Quick Reference

**❌ Avoid**:
- `Error handling needed in agent.py` (no emoji, no label suggestion)
- `Add streaming support` (no emoji, no label suggestion)
- `🐛bug: fix error` (poor formatting)

**✅ Correct**:
- Title with emoji: `🐛 Add error handling for litellm.completion() to ensure checkpoint saves error responses`
- Brief description with context and impact
- Suggested labels: `bug` (or `bug`, `help wanted` if needs extra attention)

This standard ensures consistent, scannable, and informative issue titles that make it easy to identify issue types at a glance.
