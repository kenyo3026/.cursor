# Incremental Development Approach

## Core Principle

When generating new code, modules, or features, **start with core functionality first, then gradually expand**.

All implementations must:
- **Align with system design** — Follow existing architecture, patterns, and conventions
- **Apply minimal reasonable change** — Make the smallest change set that achieves the goal without unnecessary scope creep

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. **Start Simple**
- Implement the minimal viable version that works
- Focus on the primary use case
- Avoid over-engineering in the initial implementation

### 2. **Build Incrementally**
- Add complexity only when needed
- Extend functionality in logical steps
- Each iteration should be functional and testable

### 3. **Expand Gradually**
- Add edge case handling after core works
- Introduce advanced features as follow-up enhancements
- Consider performance optimizations in later iterations

## Examples

**❌ Avoid**: Creating a comprehensive solution with all features at once
**✅ Prefer**:
1. First iteration: Basic functionality that works
2. Second iteration: Add error handling
3. Third iteration: Add configuration options
4. Fourth iteration: Add advanced features

This approach ensures working code at every step and allows for iterative feedback and refinement.
